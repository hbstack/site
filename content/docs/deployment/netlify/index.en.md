This article contains step-by-step instructions on how to deploy sites on Netlify.

<!--more-->

There are multiple ways to deploy sites on Netlify, this article introduces the approach of using file-based configuration, which is more flexible than dashboard settings.

## Deploy Sites via File-based Configuration

### Create Netlify Configuration File

Firstly, create the following configuration file, and commit it to your repo.

{{< bs/collapse netlify.toml primary true >}}
```toml {data-max-lines=30}
{{% code-snippet netlify.toml %}}
```
{{< /bs/collapse >}}

> [!NOTE]
> The Dart Sass version is `-1.79.5` by default, change it by specifying the `DART_SASS_VERSION` environment variable.

### Create a Site

1. Login to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) dashboard.
2. Click the _Add new site_, and select the `Import an existing project` option.
3. Select the repository.
4. Leave the form as it is, since we've configured via `netlify.toml`.
5. _Deploy site_.

After modifying the custom domain name, you need to redeploy the site.
