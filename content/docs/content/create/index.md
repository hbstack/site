Content is the most basic and core part of a site. This article will introduce some basic concepts of content and how to create it.

## Content Structure

{{% code-snippet structure %}}

The content structure above has:

- Four **regular pages**: `blog/hello/`, `blog/foo/`, `blog/posts/post-1/` and `blog/posts/post-2/`.
- Two branch bundles (any directory at any hierarchy that contains an `_index.md` file): `blog` and `posts`.
- Three branch content: `hello.md`, `posts/post-1.md` and `posts/post-2.md`.
- One leaf bundle (a directory at any hierarchy that contains an `index.md`): `foo`. The Leaf bundle will be a regular page and the rest of the content will be its page resource, e.g. `foo/bar.md` is a page resource, not a regular page.

For more information, please refer to [Content Organization](https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/) and [Page Bundles
](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/).

## Creating Content

Create content with the `hugo new` command.

```sh
hugo new blog/hello/index.md
```

This command will create a `blog/hello/index.md` content page in the `content` directory, with initial content similar to the following:

```markdown
---
title: "Hello"
date: 2023-03-08T11:02:23+08:00
draft: true
---
```

{{< bs/alert >}}
{{< markdownify >}}
Generally, newly created content is in draft stage (`draft: true`) and can be previewed before publishing by specifying the `--buildDrafts` or `-D` parameter of the `hugo server`. When the content is ready, then you need to change `draft` to `false` or remove `draft` to publish the content.

{{< /bs/alert >}}

## Archetypes

Content archetypes is the templates for creating content, you can define some initial parameters and content, for example the following `notes` archetype specifies `type` as `docs` to use the `docs` layout.

{{% bs/collapse "archetypes/notes.md" primary true %}}
{{% code-snippet archetype %}}
{{% /bs/collapse %}}

When created, the initial content will be generated using the corresponding template.

```
