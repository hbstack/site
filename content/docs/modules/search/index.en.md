The search module integrates HB with the [Hugo Search Module](https://github.com/hugomods/search), a powerful, flexible and responsive Hugo client side fuzzy search module.

<!--more-->

This module can not be imported directly, you'll need a entry point, such as the search button generated by [header's search module]({{< ref "docs/modules/header/search" >}}). You can also write your own widget with this module.

| `stall_threshold`       | Integer | `300`              | How many milliseconds must elapse before considering the autocomplete experience stalled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `case_sensitive`        | Boolean | `false`            | Indicates whether comparisons should be case sensitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `min_match_char_length` | Integer | `1`                | Only the matches whose length exceeds this value will be returned. (For instance, if you want to ignore single character matches in the result, set it to `2`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `location`              | Integer | `0`                | Determines approximately where in the text is the pattern expected to be found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `threshold`             | Integer | `0.6`              | At what point does the match algorithm give up. A threshold of `0.0` requires a perfect match (of both letters and location), a threshold of `1.0` would match anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `distance`              | Integer | `100`              | Determines how close the match must be to the fuzzy location (specified by location). An exact letter match which is distance characters away from the fuzzy location would score as a complete mismatch. A distance of 0 requires the match be at the exact location specified. A distance of `1000` would require a perfect match to be within `800` characters of the location to be found using a threshold of `0.8`. |
| `ignore_location`       | Boolean | `false`            | When true, search will ignore location and distance, so it won't matter where in the string the pattern appears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `shortcut_close`        | Array   | `["Escape"]`       | Shortcuts to close the search modal. Empty array means disabled. See [key values for keyboard events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `shortcut_search`       | Array   | `["Control", "k"]` | Shortcuts to open the search modal. Leave it empty to disable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `paginate`              | Integer | `20`               | How many results per page, at least `20`, for making sure the load more event will be able to trigger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `max_results`           | Integer | `100`              | Denotes the max number of returned search results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `index_content`         | Boolean | `false`            | When `true`, the engine will also search by content, you may need to tweak the `distance` parameter as well. Please note that, it may become a performance killer on a large site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `index_all_pages`       | Boolean | `true`             | When `true`, all pages except `noindex` pages will be indexed, include non-regular pages, such as home and taxonomy lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `expand_results_meta`   | Boolean | `false`            | When `true`, expand the results meta by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `modal_container`       | String  | `body`             | The container for the search modal. It should be a valid CSS selector. Leave it empty if you're using single search page mode only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `lazy_loading`          | Boolean | `true`             | Lazy loading the indices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
