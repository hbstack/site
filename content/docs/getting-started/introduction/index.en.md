HB (Hugo Bootstrap) is a modular framework that built on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Bootstrap v5.3.0+](https://getbootstrap.com).
HB is not a theme, it's used to build one.

## Motivations

I'm creating and maintaining a feature-rich theme called [Hugo Bootstrap Theme](https://hbs.razonyang.com/), but everyone has their own unique tastes and one theme can't satisfy everyone, so why not modularize the features? Thus, HB was born. With HB and it's powerful modules, creating a brand-new theme will become much easier.

## Goals

- Flexible.
- SEO.
- Friendly User Experience.
